# Interpreted Flow Entities

Declare business data once, validate and revision its model with MCP, then use entity blocks and schema-driven EntityTable and EntityForm widgets.

Read `flow://guide/multipage-entities` for the ordered application recipe.
The target project references `lib_flow_entity`, the SQL and CRUD data libraries,
and the Svelte frontbuilder. Authentication uses the Flow port of
`lib_UserManager`; account selectors and client-supplied roles do not establish
an identity. Read each available contract with `flow-block-get` before use.

## Model authoring without generated code

1. `flow-entity-model-get({project})` returns the model, its canonical path and
   revision. `revision:"missing"` means first creation.
2. `flow-entity-model-check({project,model})` runs validation without writing.
   Inspect `valid` and every diagnostic's `code`, `path`, `severity` and
   `message`. This verifies declarations, not a live database or user session.
3. `flow-entity-model-set({project,model,expectedRevision})` checks the same
   model and writes only with the revision just read. A stale revision is a
   conflict: read again, reconcile the change and check before retrying.
   An invalid declaration never replaces the stored model.

The model is JSON data, including literal strings containing braces. It is not
FlowScript. Entity operations interpret it; this tool creates neither CRUD
Flows nor pages. Keep project-specific validation and side effects as ordinary
Flow hooks. SQL initialization is explicit and preserves existing data.

```json
{"version":2,"modelVersion":1,"entities":{"Equipement":{"label":"Equipment","display":{"title":"libelle"},"permissions":{"read":["USER","ADMIN"],"create":["USER","ADMIN"],"update":["USER","ADMIN"],"delete":["ADMIN"]},"traits":["Activable","Horodaté","Révisé"],"fields":{"libelle":{"type":"string","maxLength":120},"dateDerniereVerification":{"type":"date","notFuture":true}}}}}
```

For ownership and responsible-person pickers, declare `imports: {userManager:
"lib_UserManager"}` and a local read-only `Utilisateur` entity with
`extends:"userManager.User"`, rather than copying its SQL table. Read the installed entity and user
manager contracts for the exact identity type, directory adapter and allowed
roles. Never store a password, reset token or authentication secret in the
business model, frontend source, journal or tool output.

## Reusable widgets and named snippets

Find `EntityTable` and `EntityForm` with `authoring-palette` under the qualified
Structure parent returned by `authoring-tree`. Execute `items[].apply` unchanged.
Both are library widgets. Their inputs remain model driven; a page supplies the
entity name, transport configuration and selection/event bindings supported by
the installed widget contract. Do not copy their implementations into a page. Declare the application locale
once in the root source, for example `_flow.app.locale:"fr-FR"`; the
frontbuilder passes it to the widgets. Their default spacing and controls use
the shared Flow theme tokens, without application CSS.

`EntityTable` exposes `select`; `EntityForm` exposes `saved`, `deleted` and `cancel`.
Handle them with ordinary `Events` / `OnSelect`, `OnSaved`, `OnDeleted` actions:
`@event.value` is the selected row, saved row or deletion result. Keep the row
in page state and bind it to `EntityForm.row`. After save or deletion, clear the
selection, close the editor, and increment the table's `refreshKey` state with `UpdateNumber`
(`operation:"increment"`, `step:1`) to reload its current page. A New command clears the row and opens the creation form.
Handle `OnCancel` by closing the editor and clearing its row as well.
Use the conflict reload command before retrying a stale revision; do not blindly
resubmit the stale row. Effective permissions disable immutable-row updates and
hide forbidden deletion actions.

```svelte
<script module>export const _flow = { sourceVersion: 2 };</script>
<FlowComponent $$id="selectionExample">
  <Variables><State $$id="row" type="object" value={null} /></Variables>
  <Structure>
    <EntityTable $$id="equipment" entity="Equipement" targetProject="EquipmentApp">
      <Events><OnSelect $$id="selected"><Actions>
        <SetValue $$id="keepRow" target="page.row" value="@event.value" />
      </Actions></OnSelect></Events>
    </EntityTable>
    <EntityForm $$id="edit" entity="Equipement" targetProject="EquipmentApp" row="@page.row" />
  </Structure>
</FlowComponent>
```

Named snippet parameters are lexical sources, with the schema declared in the
component descriptor; they appear in pickers and are preserved by source edits:

| Widget slot | Parameters in order |
| --- | --- |
| table `cell` | `row`, `field` |
| table `actions` | `row`, `context` |
| table `toolbar` | `context` |
| table `empty` | none |
| form `field` | `field`, `value`, `set`, `error` |
| form `actions` | `context` |

Use `<Cell><Text text="@row.values.libelle" /></Cell>` for a row field and
`@field.label` for the declared field's label. A generic cell override should
use the current field, rather than rendering the same field in every column.
The `set` argument is a callback value for a native input component's declared
setter property; it is not a FlowScript function call. Pass it unchanged as
`@set` to a compatible component and keep `@value` and `@error` alongside it.
Do not introduce an inline browser script to run it. Read the installed input
component contract before replacing the default field renderer.

Native Svelte callers can also pass `cell_<field>` / `field_<field>` overrides,
for example `cell_libelle` and `field_noteInterne`. These are concrete names,
not angle-bracket wildcard slots. Preserve all other slots during an edit.

The server removes hidden fields and enforces ownership, permissions and
revision checks. Hiding an action or a management link is only presentation.
Test anonymous, ordinary-user and administrator sessions over HTTP, then test
the pages. A page loading or a successful model write is not that proof.

## Atomic business actions: borrow and return a book

Use **one backend Flow with `sql.transaction` child nodes** for a business
operation that writes several entities. `entity.save` joins the parent SQL
transaction; its hooks and allowlisted journal writes join it too. This needs
no new entity block, generated CRUD Flow, or Java change.

Preconditions for this example:

- `Livre` has `disponible: boolean` (default true); `Pret` has the `livre`
  and `adherent` relations and `rendu: boolean` (default false).
- Both `Livre` and `Pret` use the `Révisé` trait, on the same named SQL
  connection `app`. Initialize the schema explicitly as ADMIN before use.
- The authenticated application role has read/create/update rights needed by
  the operation. This example grants the two writes to `BIBLIOTHECAIRE`;
  `ADHERENT` does not acquire those rights by calling the Flow. Keep the real
  session actor provider and the model's ownership rules. A domain member key
  is not automatically the authenticated user's identifier.
- Add the `lib_flow_entity` project reference. Read the installed contracts of
  `sql.transaction`, `entity.read` and `entity.save` before adapting the names.

Borrow in a single request:

```javascript
const _flow = {
  sourceVersion: 2,
  authenticatedContextRequired: true,
  inputs: { livre: { type: "object" }, adherent: { type: "string" } },
}

function Emprunter({ input, config, result }) {
  sql.transaction({
    connection: "app",
    $$nodes: function () {
      local.livre = entity.read({ entity: "Livre", key: input.livre })
      if (!local.livre.values.disponible) {
        throw { code: "LIVRE_INDISPONIBLE", message: "Livre déjà emprunté", status: 409 }
      }
      local.pret = entity.save({
        entity: "Pret",
        values: { livre: local.livre.key.id, adherent: input.adherent, rendu: false },
      })
      local.updated = entity.save({
        entity: "Livre",
        key: local.livre.key,
        revision: local.livre.revision,
        values: { disponible: false },
      })
    },
  })
  result.pret = local.pret
}
```

Return in a single request:

```javascript
const _flow = { sourceVersion: 2, authenticatedContextRequired: true, inputs: { pret: { type: "object" } } }

function Rendre({ input, config, result }) {
  sql.transaction({
    connection: "app",
    $$nodes: function () {
      local.pret = entity.read({ entity: "Pret", key: input.pret })
      if (local.pret.values.rendu) {
        throw { code: "PRET_DEJA_RENDU", message: "Prêt déjà rendu", status: 409 }
      }
      local.livre = entity.read({ entity: "Livre", key: { id: local.pret.values.livre } })
      local.closed = entity.save({
        entity: "Pret",
        key: local.pret.key,
        revision: local.pret.revision,
        values: { rendu: true },
      })
      local.updated = entity.save({
        entity: "Livre",
        key: local.livre.key,
        revision: local.livre.revision,
        values: { disponible: true },
      })
    },
  })
  result.pret = local.closed
}
```

`livre` and `pret` inputs are resource keys such as `{id:"1"}`. Use the revision
read **inside** the transaction. A stale competing writer conflicts and rolls
back the new loan as well. On conflict, reload and retry the entire business
action; do not retry only the last save. An identity sequence may have gaps
after rollback; this is not an orphaned record.

Keep the default `onError:"throw"`, propagate every failure, and return the
business result after the scope commits. Do not catch and suppress a child
failure, return early inside the scope, or send mail/HTTP side effects there:
JDBC rollback only covers database writes on that connection. Two successive
HTTP calls to EntityGateway are separate transactions. The `steps` form of
`sql.transaction` is for configured named SQL statements; entity calls belong
in `$$nodes`, without an additional nested `sql.transaction`.

For loans, use these business actions from frontend ordinary actions rather
than exposing the two writes as separate form submissions. A transaction does
not itself prohibit another permitted CRUD route: model permissions and server
hooks must also cover any route the application exposes. It does not grant
privileges to an ADHERENT or impersonate a librarian.

Regression: `lib_flow_entity/tests/borrowing-transaction.js`, run with
`tools/run-borrowing-tests.sh` (HSQLDB by default, `postgresql` with JDBC test
environment variables). It verifies committed borrow/return, unavailable-book
refusal, failure between and after both writes, validation of the second save,
stale competing borrow, failed return, audit rollback, and a negative control
without the parent scope. The stale competitor is a deterministic interleaving,
not a simultaneous-thread stress test.
